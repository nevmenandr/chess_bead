Welcome to Chess Bead Game's documentation!
================================================

Description
----------------

Package for the both chess and Chinese poetry game. The rules of the game involve chess moves from games in pgn format. The board for the game is a Chinese poem of the Tang era, in which the line is equal to 7 characters (the last, 8th vertical is most often punctuation marks). When a piece makes a move, the characters on the board change places. The character on which the piece was is moved to the place of the character to which the move was made.
